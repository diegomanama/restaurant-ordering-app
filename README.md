# Restaurant Ordering App

## Project Overview

This restaurant ordering app was built as a **solo project** while following the Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path.

The original assignment provided:

- Figma design files
- Core feature requirements
- Stretch goals

I implemented all required and stretch goals, and extended the project with additional features and custom design changes. While the final result includes my own improvements and stylistic decisions, the project concept, initial design direction, and requirements were provided by Scrimba.

This is **not a 100% original concept**, but rather my personal implementation and extension of a guided solo project.

## My Contributions Beyond the Brief

- Implemented all required functionality
- Completed stretch goals
- Added extra features beyond the original specification
- Customized the UI design
- Refactored and organized the code according to my own conventions
